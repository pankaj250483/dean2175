Hey,  

I would like to ask, if you can do some html (or java) coding for an online tool 
I want to use on my website. 
It´s a simple calculator like this one: 

https://www.etf-charts.com/etf-sparplan-rechner 

===========

It´s a calculatur for the compound interest effect.  
You enter: 
- how much money you can spend per month 
- what interest rate you achieve with your investments 
- with how much money you start 
- how old you are and at what time you will get the money (duration of investing) 
- how old you will become (as a guess)  

than the calculation will show you two things: 
1. how much money you will get at the end of your duration of investing 
2. how much money you will receive on a monthly basis, if you make withdrawels from this amount until your end   

It should be in java script or in html, that I can put it easily on my website
