Hey,  

I would like to ask, if you can do some html (or java) coding for an online tool 
I want to use on my website. 
It´s a simple calculator like this one: 

https://www.etf-charts.com/etf-sparplan-rechner 

===========

This is my website:

www.deangroening.de

Colors I use:

328DAA (RGB 50, 141, 170)
8ED3F4 /RGB 142, 211, 244)

Font:

Open Sans

Logo for white and black background

==========

(1) I will get you the formula and a excel sheet as soon as I can (tonight or latest on sunday)

(2) I use Chimpify as a content system (www.chimpify.de). I am able to include html or javascript.

(3) I don`t know what, bootstrap is, I am sorry ...

If you need anything else: Just let me know

===========

It´s a calculatur for the compound interest effect.  
You enter: 
- how much money you can spend per month 
- what interest rate you achieve with your investments 
- with how much money you start 
- how old you are and at what time you will get the money (duration of investing) 
- how old you will become (as a guess)  

than the calculation will show you two things: 
1. how much money you will get at the end of your duration of investing 
2. how much money you will receive on a monthly basis, if you make withdrawels from this amount until your end   

It should be in java script or in html, that I can put it easily on my website
